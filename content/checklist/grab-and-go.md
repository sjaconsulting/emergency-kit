# Grab & Go Checklist

Your Grab and Go List is a prioritized list of irreplaceable possessions that you will take if you have time to evacuate. Often called the Top 10 in 10, think about what 10 items you would take if you had 10 minutes to evacuate.
Ideally, you should note the item and where it is located in your house to save time. **You may also want to create a separate list for each family member.**
Keep a copy of all lists in your **Evacuation Backpack** so you can easily locate them during an evacuation. Add to the list as you see fit.
