# Evacuation Backpack

Your Evacuation Backpack contains those things you want to take with you that will help keep you and your family safe during an evacuation, as well as help speed your recovery from a disaster. Most items from this kit will easily fit into a medium size duffle bag or backpack. You may find many of these items around your house, but in an emergency evacuation you may not have time to gather all of them. Add to the list as you see fit. Original documents such as birth, marriage and death records should be kept in a safe deposit box away from your home.
