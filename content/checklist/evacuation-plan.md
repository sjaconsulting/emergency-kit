# Evacuation Plan Checklist

**Evacuate immediately if told to do so, as delaying could risk your life.**
An emergency or disaster may occur when family members are together or away at work or school. Having a family emergency plan will give you the reassurance that family members will be able to take care of themselves

- Prepare for an Evacuation

    Here are a few steps to prepare in case you have to leave your home after a disaster:

    - [ ]  Talk with your family about what you would do during, and immediately after, a disaster, regardless of where you may be.
    - [ ]  Practice Drop, Cover and Hold On as you would during an earthquake, so everyone knows what to do.
    - [ ]  Make sure everyone knows how to text, as voice messages or calls may not be operational after a large-scale disaster.
    - [ ]  Designate a meeting place where you will all reunite if you’re not together during the disaster. Perhaps a nearby church, school, or community center.
    - [ ]  Identify an out-of-area phone contact since you may have a better chance of getting a phone call to connect to a number 200 miles away, than a local number. This contact person can pass information on to the rest of your family that you’re ok. Make sure your child has this number in their school backpack.
    - [ ]  Know how to turn off your gas and water. Keep a wrench by the gas meter. Only turn off the gas if you smell “rotten eggs” or hear a whooshing sound. Show your children where the gas meter is located and if they are alone and smell gas, have them go to an adult neighbor for help to turn it off.
    - [ ]  Know your children’s school plan and what you need to do to check them out if students are to be dismissed.
    - [ ]  Emergency Contact cards for each member of the family.
    - [ ]  Register your cell phone numbers with Alert Marin to receive emergency notifications.
    - [ ]  Make copies of important documents and photos. They can be scanned and stored on a portable hard drive or online storage service. This might include passports, birth certificates, marriage licenses, insurance, and mortgage papers.
    - [ ]  Consider getting earthquake insurance and look into renter’s insurance.
    - [ ]  Take photos or home movies of your home and possessions and store in a place other than your home.

- If You Are Told to PREPARE to Evacuate

    - [ ]  Listen to your local radio (740 AM, 810 AM, 88.5 FM) and follow directions of local emergency
    officials.
    - [ ]  Alert your neighbors to the danger, especially if they are seniors, disabled, or children who may be home alone.
    - [ ]  Move your car off of the street so that you do not block emergency vehicles.
    - [ ]  Park your car in your driveway with the front facing the street. Leave keys in ignition. Roll up
    windows.
    - [ ]  Get dressed in cotton or wool long pants, long sleeved shirt, and sturdy shoes. Carry gloves, handkerchief or mask to cover your face, goggles, and flashlight.
    - [ ]  Assemble your irreplaceable possessions (photo albums, original art, computer records, insurance records, etc.). Use your Grab and Go Checklist.
    - [ ]  Prepare to evacuate on foot. Use your green or blue garbage cans to cart items if necessary. Take your Evacuation Backpacks with you.
    - [ ]  Take your pets with you if you can.
    - [ ]  Post a note telling others when you left and where you are going.

- When You Evacuate

    - [ ]  If you are driving, get off the road and out of the way when confronted by approaching fire trucks.
    - [ ]  If the roads out of your neighborhood become impassable due to abandoned vehicles or the approaching fire, evacuate on foot or bicycle using pre-determined routes to arrive at a pre- determined family meeting place. This could be a community center, school, church or park, wherever your family has decided to evacuate to. Your decision at the time may be determined by the event and location of the threat.
    - [ ]  Do not leave your car where it will block the road or hinder firefighters.

- If a Fire Breaks Out in Your Home

    - [ ]  **Call 911**. Call out or account for all family members and pets.
    - [ ]  Test doors for heat using the back of your hand. If you feel any heat, don’t open the door, and
    use an alternate exit.
    - [ ]  If door is cool, open carefully, checking for smoke or flames.
    - [ ]  Crawl with your head 12-24 inches above the ground to stay under the smoke.
    - [ ]  Once you are out of a burning building, do not go back inside for any reason.
    - [ ]  Meet your family in a designated meeting place.
