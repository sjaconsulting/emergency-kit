# Mini-Survival Kits

There is no guarantee that you will be home when disaster strikes. Think about what you need if you must stay at work for several days, rely on your car for short-term shelter, or be forced to make your way home on foot. Storing your supplies in a small backpack will make them convenient to carry if you need to walk home.
